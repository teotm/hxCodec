Branch Guide
- [master](https://github.com/teotm/hxCodec/tree/master) - Use it if you want to use hxCodec 3.0.2
- [develop](https://github.com/teotm/hxCodec/tree/develop) - Same as [master](https://github.com/teotm/hxCodec/tree/master), but with fixed local libs issue
- [old](https://github.com/teotm/hxCodec/tree/old) - No idea why do I still have it lolz. It was pretty much for FNF purposes besides, it's really old and I don't think anyone would use that anymore

Also, don't download this branch. It's empty obviously and contains this one file.
